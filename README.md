//#include <stdio.h>
//void print_squares(int n, int m) {
//int size, i, j;
This declares a function print_squares that takes two integer arguments n and m, and three integer variables size, i, and j.

//while (n > 0 && m > 0) {
This sets up a loop that will continue as long as both n and m are positive.

//ze = n > m ? m : n;
This sets the variable size to the smaller of n and m. This ensures that the squares we cut out of the paper will be as large as possible.

//intf("%dx%d, ", size, size);
This prints the size of the square we just cut out to the console. The format specifier %d is used to print an integer.

//r (i = 0; i < n / size; i++) {
//r (j = 0; j < m / size; j++) {
//intf("1x1, ");
This prints the remaining 1x1 squares that are left over after cutting the larger square. We use two nested loops to print a series of "1x1, " strings.

// (n % size == 0) {  = 0;
//else {  %= size;
// (m % size == 0) { m = 0;
//else {  %= size;
This updates the values of n and m based on the size of the square we just cut out. If the remaining paper can be evenly divided into squares of size size, we update the corresponding dimension to zero, indicating that there is no more paper in that direction. Otherwise, we update the other dimension by taking the remainder after dividing by size. This ensures that we cut out the largest possible squares from the paper.

//intf("\n");
This ends the loop and prints a newline character to the console to make the output more readable.

int main() {
int n, m;
printf("Enter the dimensions of the paper (N M): ");
scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
printf("The series of squares that can be made are: ");
print_squares(n, m);
return 0;
This is the main function. It prompts the user to enter the dimensions of the paper, reads the values into the variables n and m using scanf, and then calls print_squares with these values. Finally, it returns 0 to indicate successful completion of the program.
